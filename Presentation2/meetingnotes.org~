Kaijun: number is how many parts you want
- checks only the first factor by default
- http://www.inside-r.org.packages/cran/psych/docs/mat.sort

 - K: we want one or two clusters, so it regresses the columns of the
 covariance matrix

 - How can I use the top three or four? (It sorts by the first factor by default)
 - fa( )

 - *Select f=1 and f=2 and display the correlation matrices*
 - Does the structure change?

 - f=2, first two or only the second?
 - K: it groups the columns

 - *dowload the function and unpack that function*
